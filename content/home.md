intro: >-
  What I love the most has nothing to do with the sport. It's inspiring people I
  get to surround myself with, the mental & physical barriers I have to break
  through, and the life lessons the sport will leave me with. Having given up my
  career to pursue being an athlete, really makes me appreciate this
  opportunity.
